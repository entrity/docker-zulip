## The problem

3 cron jobs were scheduled for the same time. They eat up all the memory, which leads to thrashing (swapping), which eats all of the CPU.

## The solution

Replace 3 files in `/etc/cron.d` with a single file which runs the three tasks in parallel.

```bash
# On the host
docker exec -it -u zulip zulip_zulip_1 bash
# In the container
cat <<-EOF > ~zulip/sequential-cron-tasks-5am.sh
#!/bin/bash

# sequential-cron-tasks-5am.sh

# Run 3 tasks which used to be in /etc/cron.d. I moved them out because they
# were scheduled for the same time and when they ran, it depleted the
# machine's memory.

cd /home/zulip/deployments/current/ && ./manage.py delete_old_unclaimed_attachments -f >/dev/null

cd /home/zulip/deployments/current/ && ./manage.py soft_deactivate_users -d >/dev/null

# This one is really only supposed to run on Sundays
cd /home/zulip/deployments/current/ && ./manage.py update_channel_recently_active_status >/dev/null
EOF
chown zulip:zulip ~zulip/sequential-cron-tasks-5am.sh
cat <<-EOF > /etc/cron.d/sequential-tasks-to-save-memory-5am
MAILTO=zulip
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
SHELL=/bin/bash
USER=zulip
RUNNING_UNDER_CRON=1
HTTP_proxy="http://localhost:4750"
HTTPS_proxy="http://localhost:4750"

0 5 * * *    zulip    cd /home/zulip/ && bash sequential-cron-tasks-5am.sh
EOF
rm /etc/cron.d/update-channel-recently-active-status /etc/cron.d/delete-old-unclaimed-attachments /etc/cron.d/soft-deactivate-users
```

## Journal

I found that the CPU was being eaten up and taking down all services every so often.

I downloaded an atop log form `/var/log/atop` and reviewed it on my laptop (moving it from eastern time to pacific time): `atop -r atop_20250921 -b 21:57 -e 22:04 -l`. That gave 3 snapshots: smooth sailing, low available memory, very low available memory.

It was these processes that showed up in the 2nd and 3rd snapshots which made the difference:
```
44093       - D   7% python3 ./manage.py update_channel_recently_active_status
44094       - D   7% python3 ./manage.py delete_old_unclaimed_attachments -f
44095       - D   7% python3 ./manage.py soft_deactivate_users -d
```

And looking at the first of those processes, I see its ancestors are:
```bash
/bin/bash -c    cd /home/zulip/deployments/current/ && ./manage.py update_channel_recently_active_status >/dev/null
/usr/sbin/CRON -f -L 15
/usr/sbin/cron -f -L 15
/usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/supervisord -n -c /etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf
# After that, it appears to go to the docker service itself: containerd-shim
```
These processes are in the cgroup `/system.slice/docker-ed77d1877cdfd7c9272a5ba9d25043933365e80d41`, which is a giveaway that it's running in a docker container. The cgroup's name suggests it's probably the container whose id is `ed77d1877cdf`, which runs the zulip application, which is where I expected to find these processes in the first place.

Within the container, I found where thse processes were scheduled:
```bash
grep -rP '^\d+ 5' /etc/cron.*
# => /etc/cron.d/update-channel-recently-active-status:
# =>     0 5 * * 0    zulip    cd /home/zulip/deployments/current/ && ./manage.py update_channel_recently_active_status >/dev/null
# => /etc/cron.d/delete-old-unclaimed-attachments:
# =>     0 5 * * *    zulip    cd /home/zulip/deployments/current/ && ./manage.py delete_old_unclaimed_attachments -f >/dev/null
# => /etc/cron.d/soft-deactivate-users:
# =>     0 5 * * *    zulip    cd /home/zulip/deployments/current/ && ./manage.py soft_deactivate_users -d >/dev/null
```

The timing looks correct because the container is running on UTC. (UTC 5 - 7 = Pacific 10 pm. And the memory issue shows up at about 22:00 Pacific when I download and review the `atop` log file on my laptop.)

So I rewrote the crontab to do these 3 jobs in a series instead of in parallel.
